# Saving Pennjamin

Saving Pennjamin is a mind therapy game that helps children reduce anxiety, stress, and tension to prevent the onset of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) while admitted in the hospital intensive care unit. 

When children are admitted in the ICU, they are often scared, disorientated, and nervous. The game uses the Muse headset sensors to detect changes in the Alpha wave detected by electroencephalography (EEG). Children can use their mind to control Pennjamin's movements, helping him win challenges through mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation. 

PTSD can occur after the unexpected or violent death of a family member or close friend. Studies show that PTSD occurs in 1%-14% of the population. It can be diagnosed at at any age, and can occur as a sudden, short-term response or develop gradually and become chronic or persistent.
